This working example with `next.js` 13 only appears to work with `next dev` and not `next build`. 
There are instructions in the next.config for next.js 12 and lower as well.

It shows how to use the latest monaco-editor with next.js and a custom webworker, without using `@monaco/react` or `monaco-editor-react`'s approach of cdn bundles that avoid using npm module `monaco-editor` or webworkers.
